Muhubot - An automation robot without presence

Hubot is nice, but it's not quite what I need... it's a little too simplistic.
This is not Hubot, but it is inspired by Hubot.  It is intended for much the same purposes.

Muhu is, coincidentally, a descriptor roughly translating to "Muted almost completely", or "Without presence"

Requirements:
    - Python
    - Twisted (specifically core and words)
    - Tornado
